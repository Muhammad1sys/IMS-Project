# Inventory Management System (IMS)

## Overview
IMS is a command-line application designed to manage inventory efficiently. Users can register, log in, and perform basic inventory tasks such as adding, updating, and removing items. The system prioritizes security by using **bcrypt** to hash passwords.

## Security
Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, ensuring sensitive data remains protected.

## Future Enhancements
This IMS was just developed as a short assignment and although it's secure enough but it still needs a lot more improvements.
With further development, this system can be integrated into e-commerce platforms or marketplaces, offering full-scale inventory management for online stores.
