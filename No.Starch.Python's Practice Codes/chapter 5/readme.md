## If Statements

Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Python’s `if` statement allows you to evaluate the current state of a program and respond appropriately.

In this chapter, you’ll learn to write conditional tests that allow you to check any condition of interest. You’ll explore simple `if` statements and create more complex series of `if` statements to identify when specific conditions are met. Additionally, you’ll apply these concepts to lists, enabling you to write `for` loops that handle most items in one way while treating certain items with specific values differently.

We will also be using type hinting throughout the examples to improve code readability and maintainability.
