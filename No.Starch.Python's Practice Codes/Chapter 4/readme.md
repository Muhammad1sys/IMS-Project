## Working with Lists

In Chapter 3, you learned how to create and work with simple lists and their individual elements. Now, you'll explore how to efficiently loop through an entire list using just a few lines of code, no matter the list's length. Looping allows you to perform actions on each item in the list, enabling you to manage lists of any sizeâ€”from just a few elements to thousands or even millions.

We'll also be using Python's type hinting to make our code more readable and maintainable.
